		<h1>or... 'A Procrastinator's Lament'</h1>
		
		<p>Ah, the "wisdom" of age.  ???!@#$!?  As Charlie was describing to us the mere 3-point deduction after about 3am, pleading with us to just 'Go to bed!', I smugly sat there thinking to myself, 'At least I'm too clever for THAT to happen to me!</p>
		<p>Yet, the time management skills which I had thought I had mastered over the last few years have instead come crashing down around me.  My problem, in programming, has ALWAYS been that I am a very [in fact entirely TOO] optimistic estimator of my own speed.  I am consistently TOO optimistic in my projections of time needed. I just don't allow myself enough time, and it takes much, much longer than I think it 'should.'</p>
		<p>And, come to find out, that optimism has come roaring back to haunt me here.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>Yet at whom, save me, may I gnash my teeth in vigorous melodramatic frustration??</p>
		<p>I can only hope that this time, at least, I will ACTUALLY learn to budget far, far more time than I expect to need.</p>

		<h2>To code... perchance to nap....</h2>
		<p  class="rainbow">There are, it seems, several items I could keep fresh at the front of my mind for reference :</p>
		<ul id="myList">
			<li>I am far too unfamiliar with the Canvas and MyBCC resources. They are just too new to me.</li>
			<li>I have got to factor in some sort of 'curiosity' multiplier, as I seem to get distracted by tangents instead of focusing on the final goal.  e.g.: 'ooo what precise colour can I find to please my eyes?'... then twenty-three samples later I realize... erm...maybe I just need to CODE.</li>
			<li>As familiar as I really am with programming, I still need to allow time to get familiar with these new tools.  Example: let Eclipse crash seven times before I finally STOP clicking on the Help - Change Font topic.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2 id="changeMe">And now for something completely different....</h2>
